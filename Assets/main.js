        small unmanned aerial vehicles (SUAVs) aims to exploit naturally occurring wind gradients to increase

        nature of real-world environments and physical systems, there is a practical need to design simple and 
        robust control systems. As such, this paper presents a neuroevolutionary strategy for generating efficient
        neurocontrollers that exhibit generalized and robust behavior. The Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies
        (NEAT) algorithm is applied to evolve networks in a way that preserves simplicity while maximizing performance.
        Simulated flight tests in stochastic environments show that resulting controllers can perform dynamic soaring
        for a range of initial conditions and time-varying parameters. Flight trajectories and robustness metrics are
        presented and compared for a small autonomous aircraft operating in such environments.`;

        and effective neurocontrollers that can control a simulated aircraft along sustained dynamic and
        thermal soaring trajectories. The proposed approach evolves interpretable neural networks in a
        way that preserves simplicity while maximizing performance without requiring extensive training
        datasets. As a result, the combined trajectory planning and aircraft control strategy is suitable for
        real-time implementation on SUAV platforms.`;

        binary phase shift keying (Q/BPSK) - to transmit a Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG)

        through the exploitation of naturally occurring wind phenomena. However, due to the limited computational hardware on board such
        aircraft and the uncertain, stochastic nature of real-world environments, there is a need for efficient and robust strategies 
    that exhibit generalized behavior. In addressing these objectives, recent efforts have explored the use of artificial intelligence 
    training algorithms and neural networks for the design of autonomous control schemes that exploit such wind phenomena. This study 
    incorporates the Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies algorithm with domain randomization to train robust neurocontrollers that 
    can control an aircraft along sustained traveling dynamic soaring trajectories in the presence of uncertainties and disturbances. 
    This work presents the developed strategy for integrating robustness in neural network control systems, provides a method for quantifying 
    and comparing robustness, and introduces an approach for identifying the network characteristics that contribute to the evolved robust behavior.`;
